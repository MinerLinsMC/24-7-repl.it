<h1>Host 24/7 for free!</h1>
I decided to make this Github to educate those who still don't know how to host for free (24/7) on REPL. I hope by making this it ensures no one has any issues, and that you to can host for free!

# What it offers
* Must be coded in **`discord.py`**
* All automatic hosting
* Almost no downtime
* Absolutely free

# How easy it it?
It can be setup in less than 2 minutes on any bot (assuming you're hosting on repl). This doesn't just work on repl, however I will only be providing support for this kind of method. If you're having trouble feel free to join my support-server (here)[https://discord.gg/6ynnWDT].
